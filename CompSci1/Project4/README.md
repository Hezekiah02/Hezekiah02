# Catacomb Crawler
## Project Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate competency with basic object-oriented design principles by implementing a text-based game called Catacomb Crawler. The game involves a hero navigating a treacherous catacomb filled with monsters, attempting to escape before their health runs out.

## Project Guide

### Dependencies
Java (JDK) and a Terminal, such as VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.

### How to run the Catacomb Crawler
Open the project in any Java IDE or compiler and run the game using a file.

### How to Play Catacomb Crawler
-Create your hero – Enter a name and pick a catacomb size (5–10).
-Move through the catacomb – Type north, south, east, or west (or just n/s/e/w).
-Smell for danger – The game tells you how many monsters are in adjacent rooms.
-Fight monsters – Enter a monster’s room and battle until one side falls.
-Watch your health – You lose 2 HP every move and take damage in fights.
-Win by escaping – Reach the southeast corner before your health hits zero.

## Lessons Learned
-Object Oriented Programming with things such as abstraction and inheritance
-Game Rules learned how to implement certain things to make the game effective.
